Psi Translations
----------------

Each subdirectory is a language code (XX). Inside each should be:

  psi_XX.ts - translation of Psi
  psi_XX.html - downloading instructions for the website

Optionally, a Qt translation can be included:

  qt_XX.ts - translation of qt

However, Qt itself already has most translations so you should not store this
file here unless Qt does not support the language at all and you need
somewhere to put it. Otherwise, try to work with qt-project.org. When a Psi
release is produced, the latest translations from Qt will be obtained, but any
present in this repo will override what comes with Qt.

Please do not commit .qm files to the repo.
